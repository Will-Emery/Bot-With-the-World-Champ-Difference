User> I am wondering what a solid strat to counter incineroar could be
Bot with the World Champ Difference> To counter Incineroar effectively in a doubles battle, you can consider a few strategies:

1. **Intimidate Users**: Incineroar commonly carries the ability Intimidate, which lowers the Attack stat of opposing Pokemon. Using Pokemon with abilities like Intimidate or moves like Snarl to lower Incineroar's Attack can help mitigate its damage output.

2. **Fighting-Type Pokemon**: Incineroar is weak to Fighting-type moves. Having a Pokemon with strong Fighting-type moves, such as Close Combat or High Jump Kick, can deal significant damage to Incineroar.

3. **Prankster Users**: Pokemon with the Prankster ability, like Sableye or Whimsicott, can use priority moves such as Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp to cripple Incineroar's effectiveness in battle.

4. **Psychic-Type Pokemon**: Psychic-type Pokemon are resistant to Incineroar's Dark-type moves. Utilizing Psychic-type Pokemon can help resist Incineroar's attacks and potentially deal super effective damage in return.

5. **Focus Sash**: Equipping a Pokemon with a Focus Sash can ensure that it survives a powerful hit from Incineroar, allowing it to retaliate or support your team further.

Remember to consider your team's overall synergy and strategy when countering Incineroar in doubles battles. It's essential to have a balanced team composition that can handle various threats effectively.

User> What are some good fighting types I could use
Bot with the World Champ Difference> When considering Fighting-type Pokemon for your doubles battles team, you'll want to choose Pokemon that not only have strong Fighting-type moves but also complement your team's overall strategy. Here are some solid Fighting-type options to consider:

1. **Urshifu (Single-Strike Style)**: Urshifu is a formidable Fighting/Dark-type Pokemon with the ability Unseen Fist, which allows its moves to bypass Protect and Detect. It can learn powerful moves like Close Combat and Wicked Blow, making it a strong offensive presence.

2. **Conkeldurr**: Conkeldurr is a bulky Fighting-type Pokemon with a high Attack stat. It can make use of moves like Drain Punch for sustain and Mach Punch for priority. Its ability Guts can also make it a potent status condition absorber.

3. **Hawlucha**: Hawlucha is a unique Fighting/Flying-type Pokemon that can provide both Fighting-type coverage and Flying-type support. It has access to moves like High Jump Kick and Acrobatics, along with the ability Unburden, which doubles its Speed when its held item is consumed.

4. **Lucario**: Lucario is a versatile Fighting/Steel-type Pokemon that can handle a variety of threats. It has access to moves like Close Combat and Aura Sphere, as well as the ability Justified, which boosts its Attack when hit by a Dark-type move.

5. **Kommo-o**: Kommo-o is a Dragon/Fighting-type Pokemon that offers a mix of offensive and defensive capabilities. It can learn moves like Close Combat and Clanging Scales, and its ability Bulletproof grants it immunity to ball and bomb moves.

These Fighting-type Pokemon can be strong additions to your doubles battles team, providing both offensive pressure and defensive utility. Be sure to consider how they synergize with the rest of your team and cover any weaknesses you may have.

User> Tell me more about Urshifu
Bot with the World Champ Difference> Urshifu is a powerful Fighting-type Pokemon that comes in two forms: Single-Strike Style and Rapid-Strike Style. Here, we'll focus on Urshifu's Single-Strike Style:

- **Type**: Urshifu Single-Strike Style is a Fighting/Dark-type Pokemon, giving it a unique dual typing that provides good offensive coverage.

- **Ability**: Urshifu's ability is Unseen Fist, which allows its moves to bypass Protect and Detect. This can be incredibly useful in doubles battles where opponents often rely on these protective moves.

- **Signature Move**: Urshifu's signature move is Wicked Blow, a powerful Dark-type move that always lands a critical hit. This can deal massive damage to opposing Pokemon, especially when combined with its high Attack stat.

- **Stats**: Urshifu Single-Strike Style has impressive base stats, with a focus on Attack and Speed. This allows it to hit hard and fast, putting pressure on opponents.

- **Usage**: In doubles battles, Urshifu Single-Strike Style is often used as a strong physical attacker that can break through opponents' defenses. It can threaten a wide range of Pokemon with its STAB Fighting and Dark-type moves.

When using Urshifu in doubles battles, consider pairing it with Pokemon that can cover its weaknesses, such as Fairy-type Pokemon that resist Fighting and Dark-type moves. Additionally, support Pokemon that can set up Tailwind or provide redirection support can help Urshifu thrive on the battlefield.

Overall, Urshifu Single-Strike Style is a versatile and potent Pokemon that can be a valuable asset to your doubles battles team with its unique abilities and powerful moves.
