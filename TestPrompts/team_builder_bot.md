Bot with the World Champ Difference> To complete your team, I will provide a suggestion for the last Pokemon slot.

I recommend adding **"Koraidon"** to your team. It is a powerful Fighting/Dragon type with a high Attack stat and a wide movepool that includes moves like Close Combat, Dragon Claw, and Thunder Punch.

If you would like to add Koraidon to your team, please respond with:
`add, Koraidon`

User> I already have that pokemon on my team

Bot with the World Champ Difference> Great! Let's move on to finding a suitable addition to your team. To start, I will suggest a Pokemon that can complement your current team well. Let's begin by querying for a Pokemon that can provide some additional type coverage or support.

Please provide a query for a specific type, ability, move, or any other characteristic you would like to see in the potential addition to your team.

User> It looks like right now I could use some coverage for water types. So something that would be supereffective against them

Bot with the World Champ Difference> To counter Water types effectively, a good addition to your team would be a Grass type Pokemon. Grass type moves are super effective against Water types. Let's search for a Grass type Pokemon that can provide the coverage you need.

Please allow me to query the database for a suitable Grass type Pokemon that can help counter Water types effectively.

User> Go for it

Bot with the World Champ Difference> I have found a Grass type Pokemon that can help counter Water types effectively for your team.

**Pokemon: Victreebel**

- Type: Grass/Poison
- Ability: Chlorophyll
- Base Stats:
  - Speed: 70
  - Attack: 80
  - Defense: 105
  - Special Attack: 65
  - Special Defense: 100
  - HP: Not provided
- Possible Moves: Acid Spray, Body Slam, Bug Bite, Bullet Seed, Encore, Endure, Energy Ball, Facade, Giga Drain, Giga Impact, Grass Knot, Grassy Glide, Grassy Terrain, Hyper Beam, Knock Off, Leaf Blade, Leaf Storm, Leech Life, Lunge, Magical Leaf, Poison Jab, Pounce, Power Whip, Protect, Razor Leaf, Reflect, Rest, Scary Face, Seed Bomb, Sleep Powder, Sleep Talk, Sludge Bomb, Solar Beam, Spit Up, Stockpile, Substitute, Sunny Day, Swallow, Sweet Scent, Swift, Swords Dance, Tera Blast, Thief, Toxic, Trailblaze, Venoshock, Vine Whip, Weather Ball

Victreebel's combination of Grass and Poison typing provides it with a strong advantage against Water types. Its Chlorophyll ability can boost its Speed in sunny conditions, allowing it to outspeed opponents and strike first. With a solid Defense and Special Defense stat, Victreebel can also take hits from Water type moves effectively.

Adding Victreebel to your team can provide the necessary coverage against Water types and contribute to a well-rounded team composition. Would you like to add Victreebel to your team?
User> add it to the team
Bot with the World Champ Difference> Great choice! Adding a Grass type Pokemon to your team will provide you with the necessary coverage against Water types.

`add, Venusaur`

Venusaur's Grass type moves will be super effective against Water types, helping you counter them effectively. It also has a good balance of stats to support your team in battles.

User> Add Venesaur

Bot with the World Champ Difference> Venusaur has been successfully added to your team. With its Grass type moves, it will provide valuable coverage against Water types. If you have any more specific preferences or need further assistance in team building, feel free to let me know!

User> What is on my team?

Bot with the World Champ Difference> Currently, your team consists of the following Pokemon:

1. Walking Wake (Water/Dragon type)
2. Koraidon (Fighting/Dragon type)
3. Glimmora (Rock/Poison type)
4. Whimsicott (Grass/Fairy type)
5. Incineroar (Fire/Dark type)
6. Venusaur (Grass/Poison type)

This team has a good mix of types and abilities, providing you with a balanced roster to handle various threats. If you have any specific strategies or adjustments in mind, feel free to share, and I can assist you further.

User> Can you help me with movesets?

Bot with the World Champ Difference> Of course! I can assist you in creating optimal movesets for your team members. Let's start by focusing on one Pokemon at a time. Please provide the name of the Pokemon you would like to work on first, and we can then proceed to suggest an effective moveset for that Pokemon.

User> Lets start with Walking Wake

Bot with the World Champ Difference> Great choice! Let's work on creating an effective moveset for Walking Wake. To optimize its performance, we will consider its Water/Dragon typing and stats.

Based on Walking Wake's typing, here is a suggested moveset:

1. Hydro Pump (Water) - Strong STAB move for Water type coverage.
2. Dragon Pulse (Dragon) - STAB move for Dragon type coverage.
3. Hurricane (Flying) - Coverage against Grass types.
4. Protect (Normal) - Provides protection and scouting information.

This moveset provides a good mix of STAB moves and coverage options for Walking Wake. It's important to consider its stats and role within your team when finalizing the moveset.

Feel free to let me know if you would like any adjustments or if you'd like to work on another Pokemon's moveset.

User> Can you give me an IV spread as well?

Bot with the World Champ Difference> For Walking Wake, a balanced IV spread that focuses on its offensive capabilities and overall bulk would be beneficial. Here is a suggested IV spread for Walking Wake:

- HP: 252
- Attack: 0
- Defense: 252
- Special Attack: 252
- Special Defense: 4
- Speed: 0

This spread maximizes Walking Wake's offensive potential with a focus on Special Attack and provides it with good overall bulk by investing in HP and Defense. The remaining IVs are placed in Special Defense to add a bit of extra resilience.

Feel free to adjust the IV spread based on your specific preferences or battle strategy. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
User> Waht is my set up for walking wake thus far presented as a pokepaste?
Bot with the World Champ Difference> Here is the moveset and IV spread for Walking Wake presented in a Pokepaste format:

```
Walking Wake @ [Item]
Ability: Protosynthesis
Level: 50
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
IVs: 31/0/31/31/31/0

```

This setup focuses on maximizing Walking Wake's offensive capabilities while also providing it with good defensive stats. Feel free to customize the item and any other details as needed. If you have any more Pokemon you'd like to work on or any other questions, feel free to let me know!

User> Slap a choice scarf on it
Bot with the World Champ Difference> Here is the updated moveset for Walking Wake with a Choice Scarf included:

```
Walking Wake @ Choice Scarf
Ability: Protosynthesis
Level: 50
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
IVs: 31/0/31/31/31/0

```

The Choice Scarf will boost Walking Wake's Speed, allowing it to outspeed opponents and hit hard with its moves. If you have any more adjustments or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

User> perfect lets move onto koraidon
Bot with the World Champ Difference> Great choice! Let's work on creating an effective moveset for Koraidon. To optimize its performance, we will consider its Fighting/Dragon typing and stats.

Based on Koraidon's typing, here is a suggested moveset:

1. Close Combat (Fighting) - Strong STAB move for Fighting type coverage.
2. Dragon Claw (Dragon) - STAB move for Dragon type coverage.
3. Earthquake (Ground) - Coverage against Electric and Steel types.
4. Protect (Normal) - Provides protection and scouting information.

This moveset provides a good mix of STAB moves and coverage options for Koraidon. It's important to consider its stats and role within your team when finalizing the moveset.

Feel free to let me know if you would like any adjustments or if you'd like to work on another Pokemon's moveset.

User> Give me an EV spread that would work well if i gave it the clear amulet

Bot with the World Champ Difference> For Koraidon with the Clear Amulet, which prevents the effects of trapping moves, a balanced EV spread that enhances its offensive capabilities and overall bulk would be beneficial. Here is a suggested EV spread for Koraidon:

- HP: 252
- Attack: 252
- Defense: 4
- Special Defense: 0
- Speed: 0

This spread maximizes Koraidon's Attack stat for powerful hits while also investing in HP and Defense for added bulk. The absence of investment in Special Defense allows for a more physical-oriented focus.

Feel free to adjust the EV spread based on your specific preferences or battle strategy. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
